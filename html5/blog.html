Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.
Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.
Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.
A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.
The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.
